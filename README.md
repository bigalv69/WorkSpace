Hello. Its been a while since I aced all three College Classes on Visual Basic and thought I'd get back into Coding

a little bit. Any help with what I'm working on is welcome, but I wouldn't pay much attention to what I'm working on

anyway. Trust me, it'll be of no importance. lol..


I'm just here to have some personal fun. I'm a Computer Tech (mostly Hardware), and that's what Computers are to

me. Pure Enjoyment!, and occassionally some little challenges, which make it even more Enjoyable !!!
